**3D Viewing Globe** 

Viewing the world from a 3 Dimensional perspective can give the audience a more profound understanding of data. This
3D map is powered by Cesium, and Cesium is an open-source JavaScript library for 3D globes and maps. 3D maps can show
information that would that can sometime be hard to display on a 2 dimensional map such as oblique view angles of
terrain, 3d models and globes are far better at limiting map projection distortion. However, 2 dimensional web maps
have a far larger resource base and need less.


The link below shows a sample of this form 
of geovisualization using data from New York City's social service department on noise complaint. This  3D thematic map
shows the distribution of complaints over New York City from January to March for 2017. The noise complaint data was
collected from the 3-1-1 hotline which is for non-emergency services in the United States. This data was downloaded
from <a href='https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/Noise-complaints-since-20151101-w-Unspecified-CB/vjav-8yz5'>NYC OpenData</a>
 , and was exorted in a Json format.  <a href='https://clarype.github.io/3DView/'>**Click Here to see the sample!**</a>

**3D Viewing Globe** 

Viewing the world from a 3 Dimensional perspective can give the audience a more profound understanding of data. Cesium is an open-source
JavaScript library for 3D globes and maps is a powerful provider for such geovisual pursuits. 

The link below shows a sample of this form 
of geovisualization using data from New York City's social service department on noise complaint. This  3D thematic map shows the 
distribution of complaints over New York City from January to March for 2017. The noise complaint data was collected from the 3-1-1 hotline which is for non-emergency services in the United States. This data was downloaded from <a href='https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/Noise-complaints-since-20151101-w-Unspecified-CB/vjav-8yz5'>NYC OpenData</a> , and was exorted in a Json format.  <a href='https://clarype.github.io/Oregon-Story-Map/'>**Click Here to see the sample!**</a>
